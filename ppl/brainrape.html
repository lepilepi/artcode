# Boros MÃ¡rton <small style="color:grey">brainrape</small>

I am a software engineer by day, and vj by night.

I lead hands-on music production, coding and visual workshops at [imPro School](http://improschool.com), [AV Open Studios](http://avopenstudios.com) and [VJ Centrum Budapest](https://www.facebook.com/vjcentrum).

I code interactive art installations in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) using [HTML5 APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

### Why artcode?

Digital creation is limited by software tools. To unlock its full potential, one must harness computation and the global networking infrastructure directly, to enable new modes of creative expression and interaction. I want to further this goal by building an artgineering culture, dispelling the fear of code from the minds of digital creators.

The Web (including JavaScript, HTML5 - audio, video, graphics, real time communications and others) provides a great platform for exploratory and artistic coding: it enables interactivity, networked installations, and universal access - from laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices - while building on open standards and often open source implementations.

It serves as an example [student application](../join.html). Feel free to use it as a template for your own profile, or use anything else you like.
