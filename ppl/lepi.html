### Why artcode?

I always like to craft things. It inspires me when something amazing can be build from just some materials, based on crazy ideas. I have the knowledge and love for engineering stuff, and I would be happy to take part in any kind of artistic creation supported by technology.

I used to work on a broad spectrum of creations, from the home-made shishas and instrument-mods to the accelerometer-based devices, LED-matrices and web-applications.
