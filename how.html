# artcode

`artcode` is an online programming study guide under development by [brainrape](http://github.com/brainrape). [About the author](ppl/brainrape.html).

The principles below provide the guiding force behind the development of the course material.


### Ubiquitous computing, at your disposal

Computing is unlike any tool ever invented by man. It gives you the power to create and transform data: image, sound, interaction, and more. But it's much more powerful than that. Through abstraction and reuse, you never have to build the same thing twice: once it's built, just invoke it, and like magic, another instance will appear, possibly with different characteristics. Making a thousand things is just as easy: just add a repeater spell. With computer networks - the Internet - you can do this independently of physical location: you summon demons from a great distance, or use it to instantly communicate with other humans.

`artcode` is an online study guide providing high-level practical knowledge of universally available technologies based on open standards, focused on digital artistic creation and real-time interaction.

Join us, and you will learn to program the Web, a platform capable of interactive, networked, real-time applications including, among others, digital graphics, video and audio, that is available on almost any general-purpose computing device, like laptops, smartphones, and tablets, without even having to install anything. As such, it is uniquely suited for creating engagement with your audience in new and expressive ways, going far beyond the limits of traditional media.

You will not be bound by this platform, instead you will extend it by seeking out and making use of any technology necessary for your artistic vision. For example, use projectors to alter reality, and controllers and motion sensors to feed information to your computations.


### Assume nothing, expect everything

We don't assume students have any previous technical knowledge, besides a working english proficiency, and basic computer skills like checking your faceboogle.

However, we expect that you will take on an inquisitive mindset, try to grasp the high-level concepts presented in the course, dig deeper and do independent research as necessary, and experiment with the new concepts you learn. We will try to guide you through the vast maze of information freely available on the internet, but you will have to learn to acquire the knowledge yourself.

The course materials will provide a high-level overview of the technologies we consider useful for artistic and exploratory coding. We will not teach you how to use them. Instead, we will teach you how to learn to use them on your own: an immensely useful skill that once you learn, you can apply to any technology.


### Study at home, collaborate in meatspace

You can learn the basics at your own pace, in your own environment, using the provided online resources as a starting point. You can do this without registering, it's all freely accessible.

[Join the class](join.html) and visit the "real life" workshops, where you will create your own artgineering project and collaborate with other students. We will help you choose the right technologies, and design, build, and debug your project.
