# Join the Class

`artcode` is a programming study guide focused on technologies enabling real-time interactive digital artistic creation.

<a class="btn btn-inverse" href='how.html'>Learn More Â»</a>

Visit the "real life" workshops, where you will create your own artgineering project and collaborate with other students. We will help you choose the right technologies and provide assistance in the design, development, and debugging of your project.


### About the Workshops

Weekly workshops are held at [AV Open Studios](http://avopenstudios.com/) in Budapest, Hungary, starting with the first week of March, at 6PM on a weekday night. Course materials will be available at least two weeks before the first workshop. There will be an attendance fee to support our kind provider, the open collaboration workspace [AV Open Studios](http://avopenstudios.com/).


### How to Join

The [source code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) of software - like most digital data - is stored in [files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file). This web site (http://artcode.eket.su) is [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source): the source files used to produce it are freely available to everyone, even for modification, reuse, and redistribution. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a social code hosting site based on the source code management tool [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_software). Try clicking the ribbon in the top right corner of this page. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, take some time to sign up, explore the site, and check out the [help section](https://help.github.com/). Be sure to [learn more about git](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-using-git-or-github) - you will be using it to manage all your source code and collaborate with others. [Try Git](http://try.github.com/) in your browser, and check out this [interactive video course](http://gitreal.codeschool.com/). [**Set up git**](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer. Test your skills: [create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo) and push some changes.

To join the class, [**fork**](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the `brainrape/artcode` repository on GitHub, and **add a profile page** describing you, your projects, and your interest in the class. You can start from scratch, or use mine as a template: [ppl/brainrape.html](ppl/brainrape.html). Then create a [**pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to offer your changes for inclusion in the original repo. This pull request is your student application: we will use it for communication regarding your application (including requests for additional information or changes to the application), and once accepted, your additions will be published under [artcode.eket.su/ppl/](ppl/).

To add the new page to *your fork* of the `artcode` repository,  **clone** the repo to get a local copy on your machine. Use a [programmer's editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor) (for starters, try [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/), [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/) (win) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (non-free)) to create a file named `<yourname>.html` under `ppl` and write some [HTML](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=html) to build your profile page (you can use anything as long as it fits in one `.html` and works in the browser without plugins). Test it by opening the file in your **browser** (File Menu -> Open). <br/> When you're satisfied with the results, **commit** your changes to your local repo and **push** the commit(s) to GitHub. Once your fork is updated, create the **pull request** with your changes, asking for admission to the class. <br/> Alternatively, you can use the [code editor](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-files-in-your-repository) on your GitHub project page, or [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) (log in with your GitHub account) to do the above in the [cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), from your browser.

If you get stuck, read the above section carefully. Links are in blue: click them, read up, then do some exploring on your own. If you don't understand some concepts, explore the Wikipedia page, website, and documentation of the technology in question. Try to find more information, or a solution to you problem by searching the web. If you're still lost, use the information on [my profile](ppl/brainrape.html). I'll be happy to help you.
